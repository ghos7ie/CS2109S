    "We can also [select columns in the dataframe that fulfils some condition](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing). In the example below, `credit_df['Class'] == 0` returns a [Pandas Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) of length 284807, which is the size of our dataset. It contains the value `True` if and only if the `Class` value for the particular entry is of value 0, and `False` otherwise. We can use this Boolean series to index the credit dataframe to return the rows where the `Class` field is 0. Does this remind you of how NumPy arrays operate?"

Be careful that some examples in this problem use data with 1,0 and some examples use data with 1,-1. \n",
